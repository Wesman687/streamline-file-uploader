## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Wesman687/streamline-file-uploader.git#subdirectory=python-package
```

## üîß Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from streamline_file_uploader import StreamlineFileUploader

async def main():
    # Initialize uploader
    uploader = StreamlineFileUploader(
        service_token="your-service-token"
    )
    
    # Upload a file (user_email is always required)
    result = await uploader.upload_file(
        file_content=b"Hello, World!",
        filename="hello.txt",
        folder="documents",
        user_email="user@example.com"
    )
    
    print(f"File uploaded: {result.public_url}")
    print(f"File key: {result.file_key}")
    print(f"File size: {result.size} bytes")
    
    await uploader.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for easy configuration:

```bash
export UPLOAD_BASE_URL="https://file-server.stream-lineai.com"
export AUTH_SERVICE_TOKEN="your-service-token"
```

Then use the uploader without parameters:

```python
uploader = StreamlineFileUploader()  # Uses environment variables
```

### Upload to Specific Folders

```python
# Upload to veo/videos folder
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=video_bytes,
    filename="my_video.mp4",
    folder="veo/videos",
    user_email="user@example.com"
)

# Upload to documents/invoices folder
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=invoice_bytes,
    filename="invoice_2024.pdf",
    folder="documents/invoices",
    user_email="user@example.com"
)
```

### Upload from File Path

```python
# Upload from file path
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content="/path/to/video.mp4",
    filename="video.mp4",
    folder="veo/videos"
)
```

### Upload with Metadata

```python
from streamline_file_uploader import UploadOptions

options = UploadOptions(
    folder="veo/videos",
    metadata={
        "category": "tutorial",
        "tags": ["python", "coding"],
        "description": "Python tutorial video"
    }
)

result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=video_bytes,
    filename="tutorial.mp4",
    options=options
)
```

### Context Manager Usage

```python
async with StreamlineFileUploader() as uploader:
    result = await uploader.upload_file(
        file_content=file_bytes,
        filename="file.txt",
        folder="documents"
    )
    # Uploader automatically closes
```

except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except FileServerError as e:
    print(f"File server error: {e} (Status: {e.status_code})")
except UploadError as e:
    print(f"Upload failed at {e.stage}: {e}")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
```
