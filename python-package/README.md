## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install streamline-file-uploader
```

## üîß Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from streamline_file_uploader import StreamlineFileUploader

async def main():
    # Initialize uploader
    uploader = StreamlineFileUploader(
        service_token="your-service-token",
        default_user="user@example.com"
    )
    
    # Upload a file
    result = await uploader.upload_file(
        file_content=b"Hello, World!",
        filename="hello.txt",
        folder="documents"
    )
    
    print(f"File uploaded: {result.public_url}")
    print(f"File key: {result.file_key}")
    print(f"File size: {result.size} bytes")
    
    await uploader.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for easy configuration:

```bash
export UPLOAD_BASE_URL="https://file-server.stream-lineai.com"
export AUTH_SERVICE_TOKEN="your-service-token"
export DEFAULT_USER_ID="user@example.com"
```

Then use the uploader without parameters:

```python
uploader = StreamlineFileUploader()  # Uses environment variables
```

### Upload to Specific Folders

```python
# Upload to veo/videos folder
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=video_bytes,
    filename="my_video.mp4",
    folder="veo/videos",
    user_id="user@example.com"
)

# Upload to documents/invoices folder
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=invoice_bytes,
    filename="invoice_2024.pdf",
    folder="documents/invoices"
)
```

### Upload from File Path

```python
# Upload from file path
result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content="/path/to/video.mp4",
    filename="video.mp4",
    folder="veo/videos"
)
```

### Upload with Metadata

```python
from streamline_file_uploader import UploadOptions

options = UploadOptions(
    folder="veo/videos",
    metadata={
        "category": "tutorial",
        "tags": ["python", "coding"],
        "description": "Python tutorial video"
    }
)

result = await uploader.upload_file(
    file_content=video_bytes,
    filename="tutorial.mp4",
    options=options
)
```

### Context Manager Usage

```python
async with StreamlineFileUploader() as uploader:
    result = await uploader.upload_file(
        file_content=file_bytes,
        filename="file.txt",
        folder="documents"
    )
    # Uploader automatically closes
```

## üö® Error Handling

The package provides custom exceptions for different error scenarios:

```python
from streamline_file_uploader import (
    UploadError, 
    AuthenticationError, 
    FileServerError, 
    ValidationError
)

try:
    result = await uploader.upload_file(...)
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except FileServerError as e:
    print(f"File server error: {e} (Status: {e.status_code})")
except UploadError as e:
    print(f"Upload failed at {e.stage}: {e}")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
```

            filename=Path(video_path).name,
            folder="veo/videos",
            user_id=user_id
        )
        return result

result = await upload_video("/path/to/video.mp4", "user@example.com")
print(f"Video uploaded to: {result.public_url}")
```

async def upload_multiple_files(files: list, user_id: str):
    async with StreamlineFileUploader() as uploader:
        results = []
        for file_path in files:
            result = await uploader.upload_file(
                file_content=file_path,
                filename=Path(file_path).name,
                folder="documents",
                user_id=user_id
            )
            results.append(result)
        return results

# Usage
files = ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.docx", "doc3.txt"]
results = await upload_multiple_files(files, "user@example.com")
```

### Upload with Custom Metadata

```python
async def upload_with_metadata(file_content: bytes, filename: str, user_id: str):
    options = UploadOptions(
        folder="projects/assets",
        metadata={
            "project_id": "proj_123",

            "tags": ["logo", "branding"],
            "created_by": user_id
        }
    )
    
    async with StreamlineFileUploader() as uploader:
        result = await uploader.upload_file(
            file_content=file_content,
            filename=filename,
